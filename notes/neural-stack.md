## How to Code and Understand DeepMind's Neural Stack Machine
### Learning to Transduce with Unbounded Memory

TODO:
- [ ] Read the article http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5648-learning-to-transduce-with-unbounded-memory.pdf

NN learns how to implement some algorithm using conventional stack data structure.

NS can learn pattern from data and transform input data according to this pattern.

How to read the paper:
- First pass - just read from start to very finish, pay attention to images and diagrams
- Second pass - after understanding Introduction and Related Work jump to Approach section, read every sentence slowly and carefully
- N pass - try to implement the working algorithm :)
