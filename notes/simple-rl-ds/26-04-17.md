|  2. intervention | [ˌɪntə'venʃ(ə)n]     | Intervention is the act of intervening in a situation. | Human's intervention is still required in dialogue systems design.  |
| 3. penalise | ['piːn(ə)laɪz] | subject to a punishment | One of the main goal is to build reliable Dialogue systems evaluation algorithm that will penalise the action-selection process. |
| 4. advancing | [əd'vɑːn(t)s]  | moving forwards in a purposeful way | What is the possible way of advancing the state-of-the-art methods? |
| 5. mapping | ['mæpɪŋ] | an operation that associates each element of a given set with one or more elements of a second set | This function does define mapping from states to actions. |
| 6. induce | [ɪn'djuːs] | produce by induction | That's how we induce discounted function Q_2 from function Q_1.  |
| 7. distort | [dɪ'stɔːt] | If you distort a statement, fact, or idea, you report or represent it in an untrue way. | User response is distorted by given some noise level. |
| 8. verbalization | [ˌvɜːb(ə)laɪ'zeɪʃ(ə)n] | the process of transformation some information into words | After system's verbalization the dialogue agent calculates next dialogue state and reward. |
| 9. constrain | [kən'streɪn] | severely restrict the scope, extent, or activity of | Researchers implemented model with constrained search spaces to demonstrate their new approach.  |
