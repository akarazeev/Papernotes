### SimpleDS: A Simple Deep Reinforcement Learning Dialogue System

Key difference from prev DSs (dialogue systems) is avoidance of manual feature engineering, action selection directly from raw text of the last system and (noisy) user responses.

About 20 years ago DSs community adopted RL. But the question "How to train dialogue policies?" still remain open.

Human's intervention is still required in dialogue systems design.

One way of advancing the state-of-the-art is moving towards `truly autonomous` learning.
