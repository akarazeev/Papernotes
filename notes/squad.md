Understanding of natural language + knowledge of about the world

Challenging task of reading comprehension

ImageNet (Deng et al), Penn Treebank for syntactic parsing (Marcus et al)

Shortcomings:
1. high in quality - too small for training
2. large - semi-synthetic

The answer to question is text segment - span.

Distances in dependency trees to quantify diversity (of questions and answers types).

Implemented a _logistic regression_.

Hirschman et al. (1999) - curated a dataset of 600 3rd-6th grade reading comprehension questions.

_Syntactic divergence_

Candidate answers were generated by Stanford CoreNLP

Sliding window approach + distance-based extension by Richardson et al. (2013)

**Logistic Regression**

Features (**bold** are most important):
- matching word frequencies (sum of the tf-idf)
- matching bigram frequencies (generalization of the tf-idf described in Shirakawa et al. (2015))
- root match (dependency parse tree roots)
- lengths
- span word frequencies
- constituent label
- span POS tags
- **lexicalized**
- **dependency tree paths**
